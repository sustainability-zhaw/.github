In the above roadmap the service repositories are marked in orange and courier-font.

Users primarily interact with the [keywords](/sustainability-zhaw/keywords) respository. 

The access to the dashboard and APIs is secured via OAuth2 using the [authomator service](/phish108/authomator) and provisioned via [caddy server](https://caddyserver.com).
